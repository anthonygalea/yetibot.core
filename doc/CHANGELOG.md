# yetibot.core change log

## 0.4.28 - 3/28/2018

- Add initial GraphQL with `eval` query support. Example:

  ```
  {eval(expr: "echo foo | echo bar")}
  ```

- Enable `Access-Control-Allow-Origin *` header so we can hit GraphQL endpoint
  from the docs to support interactive docs

## 0.4.27

- Accurately record history using adapter UUID instead of type

## 0.4.26

- Add `cron` command! -
  [yetibot/yetibot#150](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot/issues/150)

## 0.4.25

- Reply to threads in Slack

## 0.4.24

- `users` now lists all users in a room, regardless of whether they are active
  or not. This is due to Slack's [Changes to
  presence](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2018-01-presence-present-and-future#happens)
  that makes it much harder to listen for `presence_change` events.

## 0.4.23

- Change `YETIBOT_CONFIG_DISABLED` to `YETIBOT_ENV_CONFIG_DISABLED` and log when
  it's disabled

## 0.4.22

  to a value

## 0.4.21

- Listen to `bot_message` event subtypes in Slack

## 0.4.20

- Enable enter and leave observers
- Enable template access to channel name and username in observers
  [#694](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot/issues/694)

Examples:

1. Welcome users to the `#general` channel when they join:

   ```
   !obs -eenter -cgeneral = echo welcome to #general, {{username}}!
   ```

1. Send a user a private message when they join the `#dev` channel:

   ```
   !obs -eenter -cdev = "echo hi {{username}} welcome to #dev! | replyto {{username}}"
   ```

It also works for `leave` events:

```
!obs -eleave -cdev = "echo hi {{username}} welcome to #dev! | replyto {{username}}"
```

  `<https://www.google.com/>`.

## 0.4.1

- Fix fn airity bug in IRC where multi-line messages would error

## 0.4.0

  It was getting quite unweidly and inconsistent with somewhat arbitrary
  hierarchies.

    configuration.
  - Use [Environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) for immutable config
    and [dec](https://github.com/devth/dec) to explode flat config into nested
    maps
  - Use `yetibot.core.config-mutable` for mutable parts
  - Use [schema](https://github.com/plumatic/schema) to validate the expected
    shape of config when obtaining via `get-config`

- Upgraded to Clojure 1.8.0
- Upgraded many dependencies

## 0.3.17

  `category`

## 0.3.3

  rooms. All categories are enabled by default. Categories docs are at
  [CATEGORIES](doc/CATEGORIES.md). See command usage with `help category`.

## 0.3.2

- Re-release due to Clojars downtime

## 0.3.1

- Fix unwords when a non-collection is passed to it
- Pass room settings as `:settings` key to all command handlers
- Fix bug where yetibot was observing itself, causing potential infinite loops

## 0.3.0

- Deprecated Campfire adapter but left code in place in case anyone wants to
  port it to the new protocol-based adapter system. If you use Campfire and want
  it to be supported but don't want to PR let me know and I'll re-add it. It was
  removed because I wasn't sure anyone uses Campfire.

- Huge refactoring of adapters. Each adapter is now an instance of an Adapter
  protocol, and there can be any number of the various types of adapters
  (currently Slack & IRC).

  Rooms are now configured independent of adapter configuration. Configuration
  is non-backward compatible. See
  [config-sample.edn](https://github.com/devth/yetibot/blob/master/config/config-sample.edn) for details.

- Refactored room settings. Arbitrary config can now be set on a room, e.g.

  ```
  !room set jira-project YETI
  ```

  Defaults for known settings are:

  | Name            | Default |
  | --------------- | ------- |
  | broadcast       | false   |
  | jira-project    | ""      |
  | jenkins-default | ""      |

  But you can also set any key/val you like.

  To view settings use `!room settings`.

  Full `room` docs:

  ```
  room settings <key> # show the value for a single setting
  room join <room> # join <room>
  room leave <room> # leave <room>
  room list # list rooms that yetibot is in
  room settings # show all chat settings forall rooms
  room set <key> <value> # configure a setting for the current room
  ```

- Disalbed AOT

## 0.2.0

- Add support for per-room settings (new data structure in config). Format:

```edn
:irc {:rooms {"#yetibot" {:broadcast? true}
              "#workstuff" {:broadcast? false}
```

The above `:irc` settings would allow yetibot to post Tweets in the #yetibot
channel, but not in the #workstuff channel. Not backwards compatible with old
config
